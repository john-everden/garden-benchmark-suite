    {"ID": "A1.2", "ANSWER": "Yes, because the system is currently unstable and removing R would make it stable, so R must be present and causing instability. Therefore, R can be absent to achieve stability."},

    {"ID": "A1.8", "ANSWER": "Observe the sequence of rotations and color shifts; if the pattern alternates, the next step will apply the opposite transformation from the previous step (e.g., if last was rotation, next is color shift)."},
    {"ID": "A1.9", "ANSWER": "Assume each statement is true in turn and check for consistency with exactly one true statement. The one that yields a consistent assignment is true."},
    {"ID": "A1.10", "ANSWER": "Perform a topological sort on the dependency graph; if cycles exist, no valid order exists."},
    {"ID": "A1.11", "ANSWER": "In a control system, negative feedback stabilizes by counteracting deviations, but if gain is too high it can cause oscillations or instability. Positive feedback amplifies changes, leading to instability or rapid growth, but can be used for switching."},
