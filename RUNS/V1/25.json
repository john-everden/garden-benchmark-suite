    { "ID": "H1.12", "ANSWER": "Problem not specified." },

    { "ID": "A1.1", "ANSWER": "Higher rates reduce borrowing and spending, cooling demand and inflation, but also discourage investment, potentially leading to job losses." },
    { "ID": "A1.2", "ANSWER": "No, because if R were absent, the system would be stable, but it is unstable, so R must be present." },
    { "ID": "A1.3", "ANSWER": "Antibiotics target bacterial cell walls or protein synthesis; viruses lack these and replicate using host machinery." },

    { "ID": "A1.6", "ANSWER": "-4%" },
